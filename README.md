1. Collaborative Filtering: Applied advanced collaborative filtering techniques to analyze user behavior and preferences. Contributed significantly to the refinement of recommendation algorithms.This user-centric approach ensured tailored suggestions based on individual listening habits

2. Clustering Strategies: Initiate the adoption of clustering algorithms to group users based on similar music preferences. Utilized techniques such as KMeans Clustering Algorithms,Nearest Neighbor algorithm to enhance user segmentation, allowing for more granular and targeted recommendations.

3. Song Embeddings: Leveraged song embeddings and content-based filtering to enhance the understanding of song characteristics. This approach enabled the system to recommend songs with similar features and have suggestion ability with wider range of user preferances.
